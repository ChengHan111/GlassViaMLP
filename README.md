# GlassViaMLP
The approach 4 and 5 are the final versions for Glass classification, approach 4 applies generalization to the dataset 
while approach 5 uses the std deviation with pipelining strategy. Reaching a better and static result than approach 4
Different from Pima-Indians, this dataset now has 7 (Actually 6) classifications to do and the accuracy can't reach that 
high score than Pima-Indians.
